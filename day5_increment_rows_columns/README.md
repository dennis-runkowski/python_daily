# Incrementing Rows and Columns
Write a function that takes in three parameters: r, c, i, where:

* r and c are the number of rows and columns to initialize a zero matrix.
* i represents the list of incrementing operations (+1).

And returns the resulting matrix after applying all the increment operations. Each increment operation will add 1 to the rows or columns specified in the incrementing list.
